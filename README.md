# OKFL
My workflow for cleaning fantasy football player data from MyFantasyLeague for the OKFL
---
My primary goals for this project were:
1. work on parsing and cleaning data
2. become more proficient with how to subset dataframes
3. get comfortable with plotting using matplotlib/pyplot and seaborn
4. find some useful insights about my fantasy football league!

## Data Source
Our league, OKFL, is hosted on the MyFantasyLeague website (http://home.myfantasyleague.com/). For this project I decided to stick with player data obtainable from MFL. The data does not reveal actual player performance (rushing yards, touchdowns, etc.) but rather it shows player scores by week based upon the scoring rules we have set up. 

## Questions to Answer
Aside from the coding goals I listed above, I did want to answer a few specific questions about the data:
1. Are certain NFL teams better sources of players? IE, do certain teams regularly have high-scoring players while others are dogs?
2. How do the individual positions stack up against each other when it comes to player scores?
3. Are there discernible tiers of players? Does it make sense to focus on players within a tier vs. specific players?
